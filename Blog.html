    <h2>Thoughts on AI</h2>
    <p>As AI becomes more and more integrated into our daily lives, we can no longer fight back
        on this technological advancement. I understand that as people, we fear our jobs getting
        taken away by these artificial intelligence, and though that can and may be true, this just 
        goes to show how we as people need to either brace ourselves to be laid off, or continue to
        keep up with the knowledge of AI advancements to learn and build our skills portfolio so that
        we can become an asset on any team or project we are on. Securing our jobs and career on a
        higher level.
