    <p>I am born and raised in Chicago. I currently and studying Computer Science and Design at UIC
        because ever since I was a child, I loved creating things and seeing the results of the creational
        process. This led me to cs, in which I am aiming to become a software engineer and or a UI/UX designer.

        In free time, I enjoy working out, running, swimming, drawing, and anything that involves
        crafts or doing something with my hands.
