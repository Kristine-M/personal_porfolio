        <h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This is a video showing an augmented reality poster done in Adobe After Effects 
                as well as Illustrator. Using Adobe Aero, pointing the camera on the poster 
                would then prompt this animation of the poster itself to play.
